IronRuby Framework implementation using C# 4.0 and TPL

This solution is a draft implementation of embeddable scripting engine. It's based on C# 4.0 and Task Parallel Library.
The aim of this project is to create the framework that can be easily embedded to any C# 4.0 application and be capable to run asynchronously some number of scripts (IronRuby for now).
